        <h2>About My Hobby</h2>

    <p>
        My hobbies include sports and painting, both of which play an important
        role in my daily life. Sports help me stay physically active, disciplined,
        and focused, while painting allows me to express my creativity and emotions
        through colors and designs.
    </p>

    <p>
        I developed an interest in sports at a young age by participating in school
        activities and friendly matches. Painting started as a way to relax during
        my free time and gradually became a passion as I experimented with different
        styles and techniques.
    </p>

    <p>
        These hobbies help me maintain a healthy balance between physical fitness
        and creative thinking, making my leisure time productive and enjoyable.
